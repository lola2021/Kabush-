// shows its new switches, each with a line of what it does and the switch

// that are still off. Nothing else: few words (Drice). Closed, it
// doesn't come back for that version. Not after a fresh install: the welcome
// is for that. Every version's notes are in Settings › About › What's New…
//
// A release edits `toggles` (its new switches, marked with its version),
// `releases` (that it has a card) and `notes` (what it brought).
