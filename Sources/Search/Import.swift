// Reading what another browser on this Mac already holds.
//
// Every Chromium browser — Chrome, Dia, Arc, Brave, Edge, the rest — keeps its
// passwords the same way: a SQLite file called "Login Data", each password
// encrypted with a key that the browser itself keeps in the macOS keychain
// under "<Name> Safe Storage". macOS asks you before handing that key to
// anyone else, which is the one thing here you have to say yes to. After
// that it is arithmetic: the key is stretched the way Chromium stretches it,
// and each password is unwrapped and put in the keychain under this app's
// name instead.
//
// The file is copied before it is read. The browser it belongs to is usually
// running, and reading its live database underneath it is how you get a lock
// error, or worse, its attention.
