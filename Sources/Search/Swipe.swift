// Two fingers sideways means back, or forward.
//
// WebKit has a swipe of its own, and it drags the whole page across the window
// with a picture of the last one behind it. This is the other kind: a disc
// comes in from the edge you are pulling from, and past a certain point it is
// armed. Let go then, and the page simply goes back. Let go before, and it
// slips out again. Nothing slides, nothing is kept in memory to slide.
//
// The one hard question is whether a sideways swipe belongs to the page — a
// carousel, a wide table, a map, a canvas — or is free to mean something. The
// page is asked, on every sideways wheel event, whether anything under the
// pointer could scroll that way, or whether the page took the event for
// itself. The answer arrives a frame or two after the gesture starts, which
// is before there is anything to show.
