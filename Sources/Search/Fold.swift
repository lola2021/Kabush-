import SwiftUI

// The column of tabs, folded away with ⌘S.
//
// The column is two hundred and some points the page never gets back, even
// while all you do is read. Folded, the page takes the whole window. The tabs
// are one push against its edge away: the column slides out over the
// page, the same column with the same rows, and goes again once the pointer
// leaves it. A short grace before it goes, so a hand that overshoots on the
// way back in doesn't lose it.
//
// The traffic lights go with it. They live in the column's corner, and left
// alone over a page they sit on top of whatever the page put in its own
// corner — a logo, a menu button. They come back with the column when it
// slides out, which is also where the window is dragged from.
//
// Folding lasts the session. A browser opening with no tabs anywhere on
// screen, for a reason set days ago, reads as a broken one.
//
// Unless that is the reason: Settings can keep the column folded for good,
// Arc's way, and then the fold is where it rests, at launch and after every
// change of layout. ⌘S still brings it out to stay, and puts it away again.
// Folded like that, the edge is met far more often by a hand on its way
// somewhere else — the Dock, the window beside — than by one reaching for
// the tabs, so the column waits for the pointer to settle there a moment
// before it comes. Folded by hand with ⌘S, it comes at once, as it always did.
//
// The edge isn't only where the pointer stops. A hand flung at it, with the
// window away from the screen's own edge, sails past it off the window, and
// was never seen at the edge at all. Just past the edge counts as the edge,
// if the pointer got there from the window, not from beyond, and once it
// rests there a moment: a pointer only crossing to a display on that side
// goes on through. And while the column is out, a pointer just past the
// edge is still on it.
//
// While a tab's address is being typed into its row, the column stays out:
// the pointer drifting off it is no reason to take the field away.
//
// The strip across the top folds the same way: up out of the window, the
// page taking the full height, and back down over the page when the pointer
// rests against the top edge. There the edge is crossed on every trip to the
// menu bar just above, so the strip always waits for the pointer to settle.
