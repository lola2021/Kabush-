// The traffic lights, where a Mac app with a toolbar has them — set in from the
// corner and centred in the strip's height — without the toolbar.
//
// An empty toolbar is the public way to move them, and it was how this window
// did it. On macOS 26 a toolbar also rounds the window's corners almost twice
// as much: 31.5 points against 17.5 for a window without one, measured, and
// 17.5 is what Claude's window and the Finder have. So the window has no
// toolbar, and the three buttons are put where one would have put them, by
// hand — which is how Claude's own window does it. AppKit lays its title bar
// out again whenever it sees fit (a resize, full screen, the window becoming
// key), so every time it does, the buttons are put back.
