// WebKit's own — Open Image in New Window, Download Image, Copy Image, Copy
// Subject, Look Up — is the same one Safari has, and two of those five do
// nothing on at least some sites: Download Image never asks WebKit for a
// download at all (it isn't a navigation, so nothing this app's own
// WKNavigationDelegate sees applies to it), and Copy Image writes the kind of
// pasteboard promise a "paste" — as opposed to a drag — doesn't always
// resolve, which is the empty box some apps show for what should have been a
// picture. Neither is a bug in this app's own downloading or copying; there
// simply isn't a public hook to fix WebKit's own menu from the outside.
//
// So the page's own menu is asked to step aside for exactly one element —
// an <img>, on its own contextmenu event, nothing else touched — and this
// app's own menu, doing the same two things a different way, stands in for
// it. Copy Subject and Look Up are the one real loss: both are system
// features with no public equivalent, so a picture with text or a
// recognisable object in it won't offer to lift either, here, the way
// Safari's own menu would.
