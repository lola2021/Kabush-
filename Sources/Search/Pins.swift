// Pinned tabs are the same in every window: pinned, unpinned, moved,
// relettered or renamed in one, so they are in the others. Each window holds
// its own tab for each pin — its own page, wherever you took it — and only
// what makes the pin a pin is shared: its letter, its name, the page it was
// pinned at, its place among the pins. Per space, as the pins always were.
//
// pins.json holds them. The oldest window's session file keeps its pins as
// it always did, so 1.0.3 finds them there; the first launch of 1.0.4 takes
// them from there.
