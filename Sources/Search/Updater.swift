// Knowing when there is a newer one, and having it ready.
//
// No framework, no background daemon: one small JSON file next to the
// download, read at launch, every hour and whenever asked. If it names a build newer
// than this one, the ZIP it points at is fetched quietly, checked, and put
// where this bundle is — so the next time the app opens, it is the new one.
// Chrome's way, without Chrome's machinery. Nothing relaunches on its own; a
// page you are reading is not interrupted by a browser that wants to be
// newer.
//
// What the updater leaves alone, on purpose: everything in
// ~/Library/Application Support/Search, the defaults under
// com.officecommun.search, and the keychain. The session, the pins, the
// history, the passwords — none of it is read, moved or rewritten here. Only
// the bundle changes hands, and it keeps its bundle id and its signing
// identity, so the keychain items the old build made open for the new one.
// The updater deletes only what it made: its own scratch folder and the
// `.old` bundle it set aside.
//
// build.sh writes the file (build/appcast.json) at the same time as the DMG
// and the ZIP; publish.sh puts all three where `feed` points.
